# Modelling-Stock-Market-Prices-Using-Numerical-Methods

The Stock Market has always been a fascinating matter of discussion, and there have been 
countless times people have tried to create models and equations to forecast the price movements. 
This has been a long-term key issue in financial studies. Such forecasting models are needed to 
predict stocks with less investment risk and to have a clear understanding of the marketplace. 
Hence this has inspired tremendous research in this domain.
There have been innumerable models that have been created to mimic the nature of the stock 
market, like the ‘random walk model.’ This model reiterates the fact that the stock market is 
unpredictable. The fluctuations in the stock market cannot be anticipated. We have assumed the 
stock market follows the standard Brownian motion process, which considers them to follow a 
random walk model. Brownian Motion is the model described for the random motion of particles, 
and the un-predictive nature of the stock market inspires us to adopt a similar model.
By adopting a dynamic equation that determine the stock index for a stochastic process that follows 
Geometric Brownian Motion, we have modelled a way to quantize the stock index's value over 
time.
This equation has elements of drift coefficient and diffusion coefficient. Our goal is to use 
numerical methods (namely Dekker’s Method and Inverse Interpolation), to solve an approximate 
of this equation, compare their results for values of drift and diffusion coefficient, and ultimately 
try to estimate the nature of the stock index, which will allow us to predict certain trends
